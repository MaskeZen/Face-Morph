# Face Morphing Using GAN(Generative Adversarial Network)
This is a project to morph human faces, using StyleGAN as backbone and using it's latent space to play around with.  This results in a model where we can change age, gender, pose of the person.

The details of the project and process are explained in the Python Notebooks

## Getting Started
**Recommended:** It is recommended you open these Python Notebooks in Google Collab and use it's assissted GPU to run these codes as these are quite heavy programmes and Google Collab provides Tesla K80 GPUs for free to use.
